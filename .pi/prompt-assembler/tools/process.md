Manage background processes. Actions:
- start: Run command in background (requires 'name' and 'command')
  - alertOnSuccess (default: false): Get a turn to react when process completes successfully
  - alertOnFailure (default: true): Get a turn to react when process crashes/fails
  - alertOnKill (default: false): Get a turn to react if killed by external signal (killing via tool never triggers a turn)
  - logWatches (optional): Runtime output watches that trigger immediate alerts while running
    - pattern: regex string to match per output line
    - stream: stdout | stderr | both (default both)
    - repeat: false by default (single-fire). Set true for repeat alerts
- list: Show all managed processes with their IDs and names
- output: Get recent stdout/stderr (requires 'id')
- logs: Get log file paths to inspect with read tool (requires 'id')
- kill: Terminate a process (requires 'id')
- clear: Remove all finished processes from the list
- write: Write to process stdin (requires 'id' and 'input', optional 'end' to close stdin)

Important: You DON'T need to poll or wait for processes. Notifications arrive automatically based on your preferences. Start processes and continue with other work - you'll be informed if something requires attention.

Note: User always sees process updates in the UI. The notify flags control whether YOU (the agent) get a turn to react (e.g. check results, fix code, restart).
